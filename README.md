## INTRODUCTION
FusionOcc is a new multi-modal fusion network for 3D occupancy prediction by fusing features of LiDAR point clouds and surround-view images. The model fuses features of these two modals in 2D and 3D space, respectively. Semi-supervised method is utilized to generate dense depth map, which is integrated by BEV images via a cross-modal fusion module. Features of voxelized point clouds are aligned and merged with BEV images' features converted by a view-transformer in 3D space. FusionOcc establishes a new baseline for further research in multi-modal fusion for 3D occupancy prediction, while achieves the new state-of-the-art on Occ3D-nuScenes dataset.

## Evaluation

We provide instructions for evaluating our pretrained models. Download checkpoints above first.

the config file is here [fusion_occ.py](configs/fusion_occ/fusion_occ.py )

Run:
```bash
./tools/dist_test.sh $config $checkpoint num_gpu
```

## Training

Modify the "load_from" path at the end of the config file to load pre-trained weights, run:

```bash
./tools/dist_train.sh $config num_gpu
```

To obtain the version without using mask, simply modify the use_mask field in the config file to False and train several epochs.

You can also acquire pre-trained weights from [BEVDet](https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/BEVDet/blob/dev3.0/docker/Dockerfile)
 to start training from the very beginning.
